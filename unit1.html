      <hr>
    <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?
</p>
      
      <h2 style="font-family:Aleo;">Answers</h2>
      <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.2em;">My own strategy on how I learn best is looking back at the stuff that we did. A lot of the codes repeat so when I look back at it and have to type it a couple times it helps me remember what I learned. Also having the visual representation is a big help so I can understand what things do. One thing that is similar with one of the students (Jasmin D.) is taking a lot of notes. I take notes during class and make study guides to study so that helps a lot.</p>

      <hr>
    <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;"> Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</p>
    
      <h2 style="font-family:Aleo;">Answers</h2>
      <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">We decided to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options because the first question only had 2 answers to it. Those options represent the 2 answers where with the 4 options they represent 4 answers.</p>

</p>
      <h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:Aleo;">Answers</h2>
      <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">I would explain the number system to someone that has never seen numbers before as a system of numbers that have 10 base numbers which are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9 and those numbers combine to make other numbers.</p>

        <hr>
    <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">1.Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have?</p>
      <h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:Aleo;">Answer</h2>
      <script src="java.js"> </script>
      <button id="a" type="button" onclick="a();"> a.The 8-bit system will be able to represent twice as many values as the 4-bit system.</button>
      
      <button id="b" type="button" onclick="b();">b.The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system.</button>

      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">2.Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?</p>
  <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
      <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">Each time we add another bit the amount of numbers we can make doubles.</p>
      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">3.How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today?
</p>
      <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
      <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">25 bits</p>
      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">4 What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</p>
        <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
        <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">A similarities is that they both relate to numbers. A different is that the decimal system has a base number of 10. The binary system has a base number of 2.</p>

      <hr>
      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">1.Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading?</p>
      <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
      <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">What happens to an odometer when a car drives beyond its maximum reason is that it will rollback to zero and start from the beginning.</p>

      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">2.When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?
</p>
      <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
      <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">When using bits to represent fractions you can't because there are too many fractions to represent or that you can't represent. Also, it would take a lot of combinations and bits to create these fractions.</p>

      <hr>
       <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">"The binary pattern 01000001 represents the number 65."Write a brief response explaining whether you believe this statement is always true.
      </p>
            <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
            <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">Yes because when you do the binary on the filppity do you get on for 64 and on for 1. Also when you do alt 65 you will get a lowercase A but 65 in binary is 01000001. Another reason is that 01000001 is the only way to get 65 in binary there is no other way.</p>

      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.</p>
      <h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:Aleo;">Answer</h2>
      <script src="java.js"> </script>
      <button id="a2" type="button" onclick="a2();" style="padding-top: 30px;"> a.Increasing the size of each sample square, thus decreasing the number of samples taken.</button>

<br>
      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation? </p>
              <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
              <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">I would make sure that the height and width are the same as the image so that it will look good using the pixelation widget. I would use the size 4" x 6". My decision would affect the digital representation because since I have 24 bits the size of the pixels are bigger compared to if I had more bits which would affect the way how the image comes out.</p>

      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.
 </p>
      <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
      <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">The process of sampling, RBG pixels, and binary sequences work together because binary sequences create the colors and sampling the RBG pixels allows the computer to know where the pixels go.</p>

When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.
        <br>
        If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book? </p>
            <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
            <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">The book is being compressed. Some of the words were transformed into symbols to make the amount of bytes that are used smaller. This is lossless compression so none of the material is being lost it's just being compacted down to be able to send.</p>

      <p style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:left;">You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why? </p>
            <h2 style="font-family:aleo; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center;">Answer</h2>
            <p id="answer" style="font-family:Aleo; font-size:1.5em;">Lossless should be used for images and videos because some of those things are personal to you. Lossy should be used for text messages and music because you could hear music anywhere and even if some stuff is lost with the test messages you can most of the time make out what it is saying.</p>
